# Inspiration
Look around the SBHacks room. What do you see more of than anything? That's right, trash! We wanted to use an IoT device to make recycling easy, fun and efficient.

# What it does and what it could do
The Trash sCan scans trash barcodes to give you insight into the carbon footprint of each of your trash loads as well as the total California Refund Value accumulated in your bottles and cans separation. You can watch the money go up as you recycle!

If you are subscribed to 12-bottle boxes of Soylent from Amazon Prime, the Trash sCan will go ahead and order a new box after you've drank (and trashed) 9 or 10.

As you continue scanning items, the Trash sCan will offer tips on how to reduce your carbon footprint (e.g. "Try to use less plastic bottles!"). These tips could be greatly improved if the Trash sCan was to be employed on a significant scale, collecting data, and tied to other Amazon services (e.g."There is a more environmentally friendly alternative available").

# How we built it
A Qualcomm DragonBoardâ„¢ 410c was used for its  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity options. In our case, an Android phone is being used as the bar code reader, but an infrared barcode scanner would be built into the machine once realized. The DragonBoard runs a python program which fetches the scan data through Wi-Fi and performs all relevant operations. The user interacts with the device through an LCD screen

# Challenges we ran into
Being a team of mostly hardware people, we had to find ways to realize our idea despite limited hardware options, but imagining the full capabilities of the Trash sCan with all attached hardware still makes the project very exciting.

# Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are very proud of our idea that is both fun and could contribute to a more sustainable world. With our limited python experience and short time span we were able to create a fun demo to engage people in IoT ideas and imagine a smart future.
